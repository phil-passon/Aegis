# 🛡️ Aegis Discord Bot

Aegis is a modern, modular Discord bot designed to help you run and maintain a **professional and engaging Discord server**. It is built on the robust `discord.py` library and utilizes Discord's latest **Slash Commands** for a seamless user experience.

Aegis focuses on essential **Moderation** features with a clean, easy-to-use command set, alongside some engaging **Fun** commands to boost community interaction.

## ✨ Features

* **Slash Command Focused:** All commands are implemented as native Discord Slash Commands (`/command`), eliminating prefix clutter.
* **Role-Based Moderation:** Moderation commands are protected by a configurable staff role (`StaffPerms`).
* **Clean Embeds:** Commands deliver results using aesthetic, consistent embed messages.
* **Secure Token Handling:** Uses the `python-dotenv` library to securely load the bot token from a local `.env` file, preventing accidental exposure of sensitive credentials.
